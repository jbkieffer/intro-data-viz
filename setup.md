## Introduction

This lesson introduces data visualization by focusing on the basic components of a chart and on the decisions you need to make in order to create and refine a chart. You will learn to craft messages about data and communicate those messages in charts. The principles applied to charts in this lesson can be applied to more complex data visualizations, but these are beyond the scope of this lesson.

## Data Sets

We will be using a publicly available dataset hosted on the [dryad](https://datadryad.org/) repository.
Download the [wolves_coyotes_foxes_dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/downloads/file_stream/24074) and unzip it to your Desktop.

tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview

systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
